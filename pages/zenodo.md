### GitHub & Zenodo

1. [Create a GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)

2. Link your repository to Zenodo. More information is [available in GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content). 


### Adding the DOI to your guide

{:start="3"}
3. Add the DOI (or even a complete citation!) into your how-to-cite instructions on the `index.md` page

4. Update the DOI field in the `CITATION.cff` file. 

{% include callout.html type="important" content="A blank `CITATION.cff` example is provided below. Don't forget to fill out the other metadata in this file!" %} 

```
