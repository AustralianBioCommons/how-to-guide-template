## Deploy to GitHub pages

To deploy your guide to GitHub pages:

### 1. Go to your repository `Settings`;
### 2. Select `Pages` from the left hand navigation menu;
### 3. In the `Source` drop-down menu select `Deploy from branch`;
### 4. In the `Branch` drop-down menu select `Main`; and,
### 5. Click `Save`

The documentation for GitHub provides additional information on how to [**set up GitHub pages for your repository**](https://pages.github.com/). Make sure to select the options `Project site` and `Start from scratch`: this will provide a straightforward walkthrough for setting up GitHub pages.


## Improve your How-to Guide

### 6. Testing functional content

As an example, some How-to Guides detail the use of the bioinformatics platform Galaxy and demonstrate its application to analysis of real world data. It is critical that the functional content included (tools, workflows, code) is tested by:

1. The original developer ( *if this isn't you* ); and
2. New users who have never seen the content before

A good example is a bioinformatics workflow: this workflow should be tested to ensure it functions as expected. This makes it more likely that someone will be able to successfully reuse the part of the guide that refers to the workflow.


### 7. Make sure that others can understand your How-to Guide
 
The How-to Guide you create will be more reusable if multiple people have worked through the content. They will either successfully complete the activities in the guide, or provide critical feedback that can be used to improve the How-to Guide.
