The default repository is configured for a single page guide, as well as an `About` page that can be used for additional information such as `citation instructions`, `acknowledgements`, and `references`. Navigation between these pages uses the buttons in the top navigation bar.

However, it is possible, and relatively straightforward, to modify the repository to allow for multiple pages with a navigation bar on the left hand side. You can even add multiple distinct left hand navigation panels that help a user navigate to unique sets of pages, and then use the top navigation bar to toggle between these sets of pages.

If you would like to set up a default How-to Guide with a single page for the main guide, proceed directly to the instructions for [adding a single new page to your guide](add_single_page.md).

If you would like to add multiple pages, or more complicated navigation structures, proceed to the instructions for [adding multiple new pages to your guide](add_new_pages.md).
