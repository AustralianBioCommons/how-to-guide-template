## Single or multi-page guides?

The default repository is configured for a single page guide (`index.md`), as well as an `About` page (`about.md`) that can be used for additional information such as citation instructions, acknowledgements, and references. Navigation between these pages uses the buttons in the top navigation bar.

However, it is possible, and relatively straightforward, to modify the repository to allow for:

- Multiple pages with a navigation bar on the left hand side,
- Multiple distinct left hand navigation panels that help a user navigate to unique sets of pages, with the top navigation bar used to toggle between these sets of pages.
