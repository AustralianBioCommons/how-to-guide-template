The `index.md` page in your new repository will be the landing page for the How-to Guide.

1. Add general information about the guide you are creating to the `About` section.
2. Add citation instructions to the `Please cite this guide as follows` section.
3. Add acknowledgments and references to the `Acknowledgements` and `References` sections, respectively. 
4. Update the title for this page. This update should be made in the markdown header. See example code below.
