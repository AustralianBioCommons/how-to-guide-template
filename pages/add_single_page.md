## What needs to be updated for a single page guide?

**A single page How-to Guide only requires the addition of guide content to 1 file in the repository template.**

- All of your How-to Guide content (i.e. the information or guidance you would like to share) should be added to [index.md](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/guide-template/blob/132851cbc0bb112cafbaa623487e4524af5dee36/index.md), and 


## Updating the contents of the main How-to Guide page: index.md

1. Select the markdown structure you would like to add to your How-to Guide
2. Open `index.md`
3. Copy the selected content into `index.md`
4. Proceed to the next step: [adding content to the About page](update_about)

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="You can also build custom markdown down content using tools like [readme.so](https://readme.so/)." %}

The template repository already contains some example structures that can be used for the content of `index.md`, and include:

- [Standard page that can be used as a starting point for any type of guide](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/guide-template/example_page)
- [Suggested structure for a guide describing how to use a bioinformatics workflow](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/guide-template/example_bioinformatics_workflow_page)
- [Suggested structure for documentation describing a workflow: based on Australian BioCommons documentation guidelines](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/guide-template/example_workflow_documentation_page)

To use any of these examples, simply copy the markdown content from the relevant example file into the `index.md` file in your repository.
