**A single page guide only requires the addition of content to 2 files in the repository template.**

- All of your How-to Guide content (i.e. the information or guidance you would like to share) should be added to [index.md](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/guide-template/blob/132851cbc0bb112cafbaa623487e4524af5dee36/index.md), and 
- All the information that describes the How-to Guide - purpose, citation instructions, contributors, acknowledgements, and references - should be added to [about.md](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/guide-template/blob/132851cbc0bb112cafbaa623487e4524af5dee36/pages/about.md).

The template repository contains some example structures that can be used for the content of `index.md`, and include:

- [Standard page that can be used as a starting point for any type of guide]()
- [Suggested structure for a guide describing how to use a bioinformatics workflow]()
- [Suggested structure for documentation describing a workflow: based on Australian BioCommons documentation guidelines]()

To use any of these examples, simply copy the markdown content from the relevant example file into the `index.md` file in your repository.
