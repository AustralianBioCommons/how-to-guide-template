## Deploy to GitHub pages

To deploy your guide to GitHub pages:

1. Go to your repository `Settings`;
2. Select `Pages` from the left hand navigation menu;
3. In the `Source` drop-down menu select `Deploy from branch`;
4. In the `Branch` drop-down menu select `Main`; and,
5. Click `Save`

The documentation for GitHub provides additional information on how to [**set up GitHub pages for your repository**](https://pages.github.com/). Make sure to select the options `Project site` and `Start from scratch`: this will provide a straightforward walkthrough for setting up GitHub pages.


## Deploy using GitHub actions

GitHub actions can also be used to deploy content using the ELIXIR Toolkit Theme (ETT). This is also required for more advanced configurations (e.g. including citations that are linked to a Zotero library).

Visit the documentation to [read more about GitHub actions](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/getting_started).
