## About

You are viewing a web page that describes How-to create new How-to Guides using a GitHub repository template. 

**What are How-to Guides?** They are step-by-step guides that support the reuse of bioinformatics tools, workflows and data on Australian compute systems and infrastructure.

The template described in these docs aims to:
- **Reduce the time you spend** creating guides by providing a standard structure to develop and maintain guidance material;
- Allow you to **easily deploy these guides** using GitHub pages and a remote theme provided by ELIXIR; and,
- Allow linking to Zenodo and **creation of DOIs** for each release. You created the content, others should be able to cite it!

{% include callout.html type="note" content="the instructions below are for a simple guide that can accommodate a few pages only: if you require more complicated structures, please contact @supernord" %}
