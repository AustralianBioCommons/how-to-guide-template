This guide describes *How-to* create new How-to Guide websites using a GitHub repository template. 

**What are How-to Guides?** They are step-by-step guides that support the reuse of bioinformatics tools, workflows and data on Australian compute systems and infrastructure.

The template described in these docs aims to:
- **Reduce the time you spend** creating guides by providing a standard structure to develop and maintain guidance material;
- **Provide further guide templates** for common use cases of the How-to Guides concept;
- Allow you to **easily deploy these guides** using GitHub pages and a remote theme provided by ELIXIR; and,
- Allow linking to Zenodo and **creation of DOIs** for each release. You created the content, others should be able to cite it!

{% include callout.html type="note" content="the instructions below are for a simple guide that can accommodate a few pages only: if you require more complicated structures, please contact @supernord via GitHub" %}


These are the steps required to make use of the contents of the How-to Guide template repository:

1. [Fork the template repository](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/guide-template) - see [this page](create_new) for more details
2. [A single or multi-page guide?](select_type)
3. [Add a single new page to your guide](add_single_page)
4. Optional: [Adding multiple new pages to your guide](add_new_pages)
5. [Update other required files](update_other_files)
6. [Update your About page content](update_about)
7. [Deploy to GitHub pages](deploy)
8. [Test, review and improve your guide content](improve_content)
9. [When ready create a GitHub release and link to Zenodo to create a DOI](zenodo)

Then share the How-to Guide!
